            Hello, I’m a passionate software engineer from Columbus, Ohio.
            Ever since I was a kid, when people asked me what I wanted to be, my answer was always the same: a software engineer.

            I graduated from The Ohio State University in 2019 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer and Information Science,
            and since then I’ve been turning that childhood dream into reality. I work with a variety of technologies, including:
            <strong>C#</strong>, <strong>C/C++</strong>,<strong>ASP.NET</strong>, <strong>UiPath</strong>,
            Blazor, TypeScript, Agentic AI, Unity, Unreal, Raylib.
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-3">
            Currently I am a solutions-focused software engineering consultant passionate about leveraging technology to create, innovate, and solve complex problems every day.
            Feel free to contact me and follow me on LinkedIn!
        </p>
